# Preface

Believe it or not,The whole world you can understand is just Information Processing.

Every thing in your brain,is exist in the form of information ,It's essentially just a lot of electrical signal.

So how can you confirm all the information you recieve is true,is not be created by some kinds of system,is totally the same kind with other people?

Don't worry about the result of this problem,all you need to know is: every thing you can feel is just information.

If you agree with this point,you can read on.

Since every thing can be seen as information or information processing,what is the AGI at information kind?

Let's talk about what is AGI.
I think it must can learn from environment,This mean it must can change it's structure based on external information's change.
if external information change, AGI have to change, otherwise it's not an AGI,because we think AGI must can learn.

I also think AGI must can do something,something people need it to do.
And it need to do it so good as human level,so it must has the same kind information process ability like human.

That is the two basic point about AGI.
